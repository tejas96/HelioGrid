/**
 * The commercial structure vocabularies — how this product is packaged and sold, market-neutral
 * and currency-free (`BM-11`, `BM-12`, `BM-16`, `BM-33`). Four closed lists and one map.
 *
 * These are NOT a market-pack key. A pack key is a market FACT that varies per market; these are
 * the structure every market prices against, which is what makes `BM-38` true — launching a
 * market adds price rows and changes no product code. The numbers live in that market's price
 * book (`T-FCORE-010`), and the lifecycle, the ledger and the entitlement gates live in `M12`.
